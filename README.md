# Snowcoin
## How it works
Traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin use billions of dollars of electricity
per year, more than some countries! This energy is eventually lost to waste heat.
Snowcoin uses this heat to warm homes on cold winter days. Miners only receive
coins if there's a snow day within 24 hours, so they are incentivized to only
mine when it's below freezing out.

The intended usage of Snowcoin is to allow students to bet on (alternatively,
insure against) snow days. They can stake some currency on a snow day or delay
occurring on a specific date. Other actors can stake reputation to report
whether or not school has been cancelled/delayed. This encourages the speedy
propagation of accurate information.

## The cryptocurrency killer
* 15 minutes after the first commit, Bitcoin [**halved** its block reward](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/630000). How's that mining working out for you now?
* 12 hours after the implementation of the core blockchain, Telegram [abandons its TON network](https://telegra.ph/What-Was-TON-And-Why-It-Is-Over-05-12) and currency.
* Who's next...?

Remember, **There's no coin like Snowcoin.**
